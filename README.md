# MPSMWebUi
Sick and tired of the stock WebUi?


Didnt like the speed of the sample WebUI?


Dont have the time, knowledge, or drive to program a new one?


Well you're in luck, becuase I did it for you!

Based off the sample WebUI created by Nokemono42,but stripped down of the least common used commands that were avaliable.Seriously who needs to move the x-axis .1mm?

Includes Temperature Setting for both the Hot End, and Heated Bed

Movement Control of the X,Y,Z and Extruder Stepper Motors

Ability to upload GCODE commands

And of course the ability to Upload GCODE, and Start and Stop prints

Follow the tutorial on http://mpselectmini.com/sample_webui#upload_custom_web_ui when you want to upload it!
